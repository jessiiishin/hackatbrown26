# Backend Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm
- PostgreSQL (for production, not required for mock/demo)

## Install dependencies
```
npm install express body-parser
```

## Run the backend server
```
node index.js
```

## Notes
- All API keys in `config.js` are placeholders. Replace with real keys when available.
- Database connection in `db.js` is a placeholder. Implement actual connection and queries as needed.
- Endpoints return mock data for now; integrate with real logic and frontend when ready.
